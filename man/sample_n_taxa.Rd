\title{Sample n taxa from \code{\link{taxmap}}}
\usage{
sample_n_taxa(.data, size, taxon_weight = NULL, obs_weight = NULL,
  use_subtaxa = TRUE, collapse_func = mean, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{(\code{\link{taxmap}}) The object to sample from.}

\item{size}{(\code{numeric} of length 1) The number of taxa to sample.}

\item{taxon_weight}{(\code{numeric}) Non-negative sampling weights of each taxon. The expression 
given is evaluated in the context of \code{\link{taxon_data}}. In other words, any column name 
that appears in \code{\link{taxon_data}(.data)} can be used as if it was a vector on its own. 
If \code{obs_weight} is also specified, the two weights are multiplied (after 
\code{obs_weight} for each taxon is calculated).}

\item{obs_weight}{(\code{numeric}) Sampling weights of each observation. The weights for each observation 
assigned to a given taxon are supplied to \code{collapse_func} to get the taxon weight. If 
\code{use_subtaxa} is \code{TRUE} then the observations assigned to every subtaxa are also used. The 
expression given is evaluated in the context of \code{\link{obs_data}}. In other words, any 
column name that appears in \code{\link{obs_data}(.data)} can be used as if it was a vector on
its own. If \code{taxon_weight} is also specified, the two weights are multiplied (after 
\code{obs_weight} for each observation is calculated).}

\item{use_subtaxa}{(\code{logical} of length 1) Affects how the \code{obs_weight} option is
used. If \code{TRUE}, the weights for each taxon in an observation's classification are multiplied to
get the observation weight. Otherwise, just the taxonomic level the observation is assign to it considered.}

\item{collapse_func}{(\code{function} of length 1) If \code{taxon_weight} is used and 
\code{supertaxa} is \code{TRUE}, the weights for each taxon in an observation's classification are 
supplied to \code{collapse_func} to get the observation weight. This function should take  numeric 
vector and return a single number.}

\item{...}{Additional options are passed to \code{\link{filter_taxa}}.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{\link{taxmap}}
}
\description{
Randomly sample some number of taxa from a \code{\link{taxmap}} object. Weights can be 
specified for taxa or the observations assigned to them.
See \link[dplyr]{sample_n} for the inspiration for this function.

\examples{
# subsample taxa, preserving shared supertaxa
sample_n_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, 100, supertaxa = TRUE)
# subsample taxa using weights, preserving subtaxa
sample_n_taxa(unite_ex_data_3, 10, subtaxa = TRUE,
              taxon_weight = ifelse(unite_rank == "g" & n_subtaxa > 3, 1, 0))
